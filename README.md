# Network_Resilience_in_the_Aging_Brain

This repository contains MATLAB and Python code for analyzing and simulating data related to the aging brain network as presented in figures 2, 3, and 4 of the paper arXiv:2202.01516.

## MATLAB Code

The MATLAB code is designed for the analysis of empirical data related to the aging brain network, particularly as depicted in figures 2 and 3 of the paper arXiv:2202.01516.

## Python Code

The Python code is intended for simulating the aging process of a healthy brain network, as illustrated in figure 4 of the paper arXiv:2202.01516. Each Python file in this repository can generate a different simulation result due to the inherent randomness involved.

Please feel free to explore and use the code for your research or educational purposes. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, we welcome contributions and collaboration.
