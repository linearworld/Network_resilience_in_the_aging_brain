# Network_Resilience_in_the_Aging_Brain

This repository contains MATLAB and Python code for analyzing and simulating data related to the aging brain network as presented in figures 2, 3, and 4 of the paper arXiv:2202.01516.

## MATLAB Code
In the "empirical_data_code_fig2&3" foloder, file "aging_fig2bc.m" can reproduce the figure 2(b-c) in manuscript.
Siimilarly, the figure 3(a-c) can be reproduced by file "aging_fig3a.m", "aging_fig3b.m" and "aging_fig3c.m".

The MATLAB code is designed for the analysis of empirical data related to the aging brain network, particularly as depicted in figures 2 and 3 of the paper arXiv:2202.01516.

## Python Code
In the "model_simulation_code_fig4" foloder, file "reproduceFig4.py" can reproduce the figure 2(b-d) in manuscript.

The Python code is intended for simulating the aging process of a healthy brain network, as illustrated in the paper arXiv:2202.01516. Each Python file in this repository can generate a  simulation result shown in fig4 of paper. Please note that due to inherent randomness, the simulation results may vary with each run.
